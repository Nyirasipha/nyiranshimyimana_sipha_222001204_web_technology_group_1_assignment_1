            <P>Welcome to fishing project!

Many of the most highly publicized events of my presidency are not nearly as memorable or significant in my life as fishing with my daddy.
Some go to church and think about fishing, others go fishing and think about God." 
I've gone fishing thousands of times in my life, and I have never once felt unlucky or poorly paid for those hours on the water." 
One thing becomes clearer as one gets older and one's fishing experience increases, and that is the paramount importance of one's fishing companions.
Fishing is not an escape from life, but often a deeper immersion into it.<br>

Be patient and calm—for no one can catch fish in anger.The charm of fishing is that it is the pursuit of what is elusive but attainable, a perpetual series of occasions of hope.He who wants to catch fish must not mind getting wet.It doesn't matter if the rod is or isn't bent. Time spent fishing is time well spent
I have fished through fishless days that I remember happily without regret.
Angling is extremely time-consuming. That’s sort of the whole point<br>
